    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>

        1. Sanitizing the data to make sure it is in the correct format for the system to accept. This is often done by a third-party software. One can also use a ORM(object Related Mapping) library for sanitizing code related to SQL.
        
        2. Take use of authorization and authentication functions. Good examples of this is OneLogin and Microsoft Authenticator with 2-3-step authenticators for extra security. These steps often involes use of a persons email account or their phone for authenticating.
        
        3. Don't press any links or images that the client are unsure of what contains. 

        4. Don't open any emails recieved from unsure or unknown senders.

        5. Employ a automatic user timeout-mechanism to make sure that the computer-absent employees don' leave essential information in other malicious hands that may come across the computer.
        
        6. Use continuous depployment integration (CI/CD). These processes delivers code automatically to production after every change has been made against security checks. If the check fails, the sending of code to the codebase is rejected. 
        The different recommended CI/CD tools are as follows: GitHub Action, Jenkins, Travis CI and Circle CI.
